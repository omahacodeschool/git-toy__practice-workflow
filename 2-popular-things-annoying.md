#What is something that is popular now that annoys you?

Something that is popular now (and has been for the past 15 or so years) is the phenomonon that is "reality TV." First off, the fact that the word "reality" is used to describe the programs that fall into this category is beyond me, because they are anything *but* real. However, even if the the executives (or whoever it was that coined this term) had decided to call it something else, I would still be annoyed with it. To me, "reality TV" is a poor excuse for producers to be able to get away with creating shows without scripts (though they probably are scripted, just not well) and professional actors (though the participants most certainly are 'acting' in many cases). That is all I'll say for now.
