As I imagine is the case for many who are asked this question, the answer is quite difficult. There are just too many to choose from. But if I had to choose, I believe that Justin Pearson would have to win out. He plays or has played in some of my favorite bands and is the founder of the label, Three One G, that records many of these bands. All around awesome person who lives and breathes their art...
